# AI research

there are only 4 important agent-flows:

1. Routing
2. Prompt Chaining
3. Loops
4. Paralellization

Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined codepaths

Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.
